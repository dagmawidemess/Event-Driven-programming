	The most important aspect of this lab was learning the communication with terminal and as well as working with VC100. Also learnt how to create different type of prints on the terminal. I also learnt about the FTP which is super effective as it lets you write on notepad++ and you don’t have to deal with writing on PuTTY knowing it's not an IDE and doesn’t give any sort of warning.
	My general approach to this lab was to dive in it as it was finals week and i knew i didn’t have time. It didn’t end up as bad as i thought, as it was much easier to debug unlike the hardware. I read the lab manual and and just started doing the lab on notepad++ although it took me awhile to set it up.I wouldn’t approach this lab any differently.
	My lab worked perfectly with no problem. It however took me nearly 18 hours, 6 hours though from setting it up.I liked how it was nice and simple unlike the hardwares. The hardest part as setting it up as i was new to this material so it took me a while.The lab manual covered decently enough.Going class greatly helped.
