	In this lab we implemented the morse code using previous experience  with event-driven programming and state machines. We implemented a full binary tree using recursive and used that on our morse code. One of the most important thing from this lab for me was learning about binary tree and and how to implement them using recursive. I found recursive very fascinating as this was my first time using recursive. 

	My general approach just like the others lab was to read anything that was assigned. After that though i decided to take notes from the lab manual as i found the lab manual very vague. I had to read the lab manual countless time and take a really good note  to get a grip of what we really needed to do. What worked well for me was my notes from the lab manual as it eventually saved me a significant amount of time as i was able to refer back to my note to understand what each section was asking.If i were to approach this lab again I would definitely first read  and watch a  lot more videos about recursive tree and morse code as i found it very difficult to really understand what it was going on.I didn’t work with anyone beside the TA’s help.

	Eventually everything worked smoothly and didn’t have any problems after a very long time of debugging; I also implemented the EXTRA CREDIT. I nearly spent 30 hours in this lab as debugging took the majority of my time. I really liked creating the binary tree recursively as i found that extremely interesting and fun. I really disliked how it takes a major amount of my time to debug my state machine as solving one problem brings another problem. This lab was definitely worthwhile as I learned one of the most important tool in coding, recursive.The point distributions seems fair to me although rubric would have given me a much more understanding of the point distribution. I have to be honest and say that this lab manual was extremely vague and some of the things on the lab manual contradicted the demo video. It was very unclear for me what exactly we were suppose to do until Max Dunne clarified it in class.
