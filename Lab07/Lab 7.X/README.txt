	In this lab we used state machine and events driven programming (Buttons Check Events) and implemented a toaster oven on a the hardware.In the lab we are utilizing the buttons for changing modes, changing from time to temperature, and for countdowns.One of the most important aspect of this lab was the state machine as it taught me how powerful a state machine can be.It also taught me how it's applied in many real life aspects such as car breaking from accelerating and more. 
	I approached this lab as i have for most of this quarter. I first read the lab manual couple of times and made sure I know what the programming assignment really is. After that i read everything that was recommended to read, the book sections.As i worked through i really struggled to debug as i had more than 250 lines of code. It was extremely difficult to sometimes what exactly is going wrong due you me using multiple nested loops.I would approach this lab no different way than I have the past weeks.
	Eventually i was able to implement everything that was required and everything runs smoothly.I ended up spending nearly 20 hours in this lab.I really like how the lab manual state machine tells you directly what to implement for you code.The lab manual mostly covered most of the things i needed however there was sometimes a little bit confusion between what the state machine and the lab manual is requiring.The lab sections greatly helped to successfully complete this lab .THANK YOU TA’s.
