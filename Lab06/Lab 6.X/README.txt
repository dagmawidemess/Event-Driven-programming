	This lab really taught me the use of hardware with C. Basically in this lab we implemented a program that lights LED and control the speed of the LED with the switches. We also learnt about the OLED as it was a way to display your program on the hardware. The most important embedded programming that really helped me understand event driven programming was part 3 where we had to use the buttons to turn specific LED. 

	My  first approach to the lab like always was read the lab manual multiple times and really have a good understanding what really is going on. This lab being 17 pages, did take significant amount of my time to even understand the lab manual. I thought the lab manual really directed you to what you really need to do for the first two parts, however for part 3 it was extremely vague especially to implement the ButtonsCheckEvents as i really didn’t have any idea how to implement it. It nearly took me close to 12 hours to implement just that function and it was very fursting at time as i found it extremely hard to debug my code.The next time i approach this kind of labs maybe I should read all the assigned reading as it was extremely difficult to solve a problem when i am stuck .

	I was eventually able to implement the ButtonsCheckEvents function and from then it was a breeze through, and my other parts were working smoothly. I spent nearly 30 hours in this lab, half of the time getting stuck and trying to debug my code.The grade distribution seems fine to me although a rubric would have greatly helped me see what I am missing, if I am missing anything.Going to classes and lab sections  greatly helped for completing my lab.
