Dagmawi Demess & Partner: Michael Justin
Michael did protocol, I did Field and we worked on Agent together. 
	This lab was one of the most complex lab I have done since I have been in school. We wrote field and protocol that allowed us to communicate with the kits and create the field with the lives of the boat.We then created an agent where it handles the communication protocol and the gameplay mechanics. We further had to use rand() so guesses are random. 
        My general approach to the lab was the same as before. Read the lab manual and anything that was recommended to read multiple times. After that me my partner discussed about the lab togohurly and made sure we knew what exactly was going on the lab. As long as splitting our own parts. One of the problem we had was debugging as it was very difficult for me to debug protocol as it was for my partner to debug field, but i would never approach this lab any differently. 
	This lab ended up worked smoothly after hours and hours of commitment on it. Working with my partner was great as it was really productive to help each other and see the problems one may not be able to see.We ended up spending nearly 40 hours in this lab and I really feel like this lab should have a better lab manual as it was sometimes very vague and took way longer than it should to figure easy problems.All the point distribution seems fine to me.
