	This lab really introduced me to what stack is. I was able to understand how RPN calculator and stack really relates. I was able to understand that  when user inputs values it stores it in the stack from the top. After that if the user inputs operator it will pop the two value the user inputted and push in the value of those two back in the stack.

	My general approach to the lab like always is to read all the reading assignment assigned as well as review notes taken from class. After that i go over the manual and try to comprehend it really well with my notes. Then the first thing i do is just attempt to write each functions by testing them as well everytime i write them.As i worked one of my huge problem was debugging my program and be able to have the right braces at the right places.If i was going to approach the lab differently then i would first have probably tested each functions instead of testing half of my functions and being over confident of my other halfs and having a lot of errors in my main.

	My program works smoothly  and i ended up putting around 15 hours in this lab. The hardest part of this lab was tokenizing it as I really struggled to understand the concept.I really disliked how we had to do all those output errors message as that really took a bit of my time, but overall this lab was definitely worth every single seconds of my time as i learnt a lot of new stuff.The rubric seems pretty fair to me and the lab manual really helped me understand what to implement for the functions. During my lab sections the TAs were really helpful and covered almost all the topics necessary for this lab.
